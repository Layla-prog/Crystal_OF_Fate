    lineText: "Long ago, the Realm thrived in lush flora and peaceful harmony. Until
      the Crystal was stolen by Zyphor, a corrupted being born from shadow. \nWithout
      the Crystal, the forest withered and monstrous beasts plagued the land.\nBeing
      the hero your quest is to restore the realm's balance by reclaiming the crystal."
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: Hey... I've heard whispers about the Crystal. Can you tell me what
      should I do first?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Ah... not many dare to speak of Zyphor these days. So you're really
      going after the Crystal, huh?
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: I have to. The realm won't survive without it. But I can't do it alone
      - I need guidance.
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Hah! I like your spirit. First thing's first - you'll need a real weapon.
      Not those bent sticks or cracked blades out there.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: Alright. What do I need to make one?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: To forge a blade fir for a real fight, bring me 3 wood and 2 iron.
      There's still some near the mine entrance.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: I'll find them. And once I've the sword?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Seek out Eedie, the potion crafter. She brews strength and stamina
      potions. Trust me, you'll need both.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: Anyone else I should look for?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Aye. Archer Kate. She camps near the goblin-infested woods. Fierce
      lass - she might join you if she thinks you're worth the effort.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: And when I finally reach Zyphor?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Heh... slow down, kid. Before Zyphor, you'll have to deal with his
      twisted ally - Kirara. A rogue wizard. Once a healer, now a poison-crafter
      serving his darkness.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: Then I'll stop her too.
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: 'You''ll need more than a sword. Allies, potions, courage... and maybe
      something you''ve yet to find.

      Kirara doesn''t fight fair - her toxins
      can rot your strength long before your blade even touches her.'
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: Any advice?
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: Avoid the fumes. Fight from range if you can. And bring antidotes -
      Eedie might be able to brew something to counter Kirara's venom.
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: 'Understood. I''ll be ready.

      I''ll gather what i need - then
      I''ll return.'
  - speakerName: Crafty Bob
    lineText: I'll be here, hammer in hand. Bring me those materials, and I'll forge
      the blade that may turn fate in your favor.
