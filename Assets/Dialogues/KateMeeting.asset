    lineText: Are you Kate? Crafty Bob said you might be able to help.
  - speakerName: Archer Kate
    lineText: "Bob? Ha, that old man is always talking about \u2018heroes.\u2019
      You don\u2019t look like much, but... I suppose that\u2019s how most people
      look before they surprise you."

    lineText: "I\u2019m going after Zyphor. The journey\u2019s dangerous, and I could
      use help."
  - speakerName: Archer Kate
    lineText: "Zyphor? You\u2019ve got some nerve, but... there\u2019s something
      about you. I can see it in your eyes. You\u2019re willing to fight \u2014 even
      if it means throwing yourself into the fire."
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: "I don\u2019t have a choice. The realm needs saving."
  - speakerName: Archer Kate
    lineText: "True. It\u2019s going to take more than just courage, though. You\u2019ll
      need skill. Strategy. You can\u2019t win by charging in blindly."
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: So, what are you suggesting?
  - speakerName: Archer Kate
    lineText: "I\u2019m suggesting I come with you. I\u2019ve got skills with a bow
      and a sharp eye for danger. And I\u2019m no stranger to goblins \u2014 in fact,
      I\u2019m hunting some right now."
  - speakerName: Player
    lineText: "You\u2019d help me? Just like that?"
  - speakerName: Archer Kate
    lineText: "Why not? I\u2019ve seen too many people fall to Zyphor\u2019s forces.
      But you... you seem like someone who could make a difference. If you\u2019re
      serious about this, I\u2019m in. The fight\u2019s only going to get harder,
      and you\u2019ll need all the help you can get."

    lineText: Alright. Welcome to the team, Kate.
